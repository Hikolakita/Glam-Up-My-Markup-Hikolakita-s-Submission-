**What I Built**

I created a form with a visually appealing and interactive UI, inspired by the laid-back atmosphere and adventurous spirit of summer camps. The design incorporates playful elements to evoke the fun and excitement of summer activities, while also providing a smooth user experience.

**Journey**

Creating this form was a delightful journey filled with experimentation and learning. I explored various design techniques to achieve the desired aesthetic and functionality. 
One aspect I particularly enjoyed was adding animations and effects to enhance user engagement. I'm proud of how the form turned out, striking a balance between usability and creativity.

In the future, I plan to further refine the form, perhaps by adding more interactive elements or integrating backend functionality to handle form submissions.
